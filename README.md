Read more about the app on my [blog](http://www.ofbizian.com/search?q=camelympics)


### How to run using Docker
The application is compiled and available at *[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bibryam/camelympics/)*.
Run the image using your own Twitter keys and preferred search term. For example:

    docker run
    -e "consumerKey=83VYApZjhdkKJHDa3qq2dq"
    -e "consumerSecret=M00Lzd5XsHnvnRpips0LSKJDLSKJDLSKJDSApy1GFB9JjNhu"
    -e "accessToken=19341814-3592zsZ1LKAJDLSAKDJVB8Z2FvNweYA0nfHACO"
    -e "accessTokenSecret=ZBk0yIqjaBbWLAKSjdlskjdkLAKohve9wvgZj2XysiTo"
    -e "searchTerm=euro2016,sport"
    --rm -p 8080:8080 bibryam/camelympics:latest

Then go to *[http://DOCKER_HOST:8080](http://DOCKER_HOST:8080)*   
To have a larger number of previews images (which is 4x4 by default) for example 50x7 use following URL params: *[http://DOCKER_HOST:8080?rows=50&cols=7](http://DOCKER_HOST:8080?rows=50&cols=7)*


### How to run locally with Maven
Clone the project and update `app.properties` as described below.
Then compile and run the app with the following command: `mvn clean compile exec:java`
Then go to *[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)*
To have a larger number of previews images (which is 4x4 by default) for example 50x7 use following URL params: *[http://localhost:8080?rows=50&cols=7](http://localhost:8080?rows=50&cols=7)*


### How to run on Red Hat OpenShift
If you have an *[OpenShift Online dev preview](https://www.openshift.com/devpreview/)*, use the following commands:


    oc login https://OPENSHIFT_HOST --token=YOUR_TOKEN

    oc new-project camelympics

    oc new-app bibryam/camelympics:latest \
    -e consumerKey="KEY" \â€¨
    -e consumerSecret="SECRET" \
    -e accessToken="TOKEN" \
    -e accessTokenSecret="TOKEN_SECRET" \
    -e searchTerm="your search term, for example: euro2016"

    oc expose svc camelympics

### How to run on [Staroid](https://staroid.com/)
See instructions [here](https://github.com/bibryam/camelympics/pull/2)


### Generating Twitter keys
 - To generate Twitter consumer keys and accessToken, go to *[here](https://dev.twitter.com/apps)*, Create New App, and generate Access Token.

 - Then update `app.properties` and compile the application, or simply pass the keys as environment variables.

 - Notice that the docker container on docker hub always expects environment variables and overrides the `app.properties`. So when using Docker, there is no need to update `app.properties`, instead pass the keys as environment variables.

 ![Here are the keys that are needed](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i8ZM3Qg4pSc/V2pt5EuSxkI/AAAAAAAAE_w/aydPXyfWki0D5uJgSgn2uYg2l1RbZR_fwCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-22%2Bat%2B11.48.21.png)


### Other notes
 - The application can run on any platform that supports docker containers, such as *[Digital Ocean](www.digitalocean.com)* or *[Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)*.

 - The Camel application has a filter to discard possibly sensitive and **NSFW content**, but it is not always working as expected with a real time photo stream. **Use this at your own risk!!!**
